# Light Switch

Light Switch will be a macOS menubar extension to switch between Light Mode and
Dark Mode on macOS Mojave.

Stay tuned ...

## How to use the Apple Script version

- Clone this repo
- Drag the light-switch.app to your Dock
- Click it

Currently this switches the following:

- macOS Light/Dark mode
- iTerm profiles if they happned to be named exactly `yungjames (light)` and `yungjames (dark)`

This clearly has work to be done on it.

Hopes and dreams:

- Switch the themes in VSCode
- Switch the themes in Slack
